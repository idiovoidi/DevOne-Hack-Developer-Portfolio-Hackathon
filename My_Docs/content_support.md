Must support various digital formats such as
Image files .png + .jpg
Local files of artwork currently reside here:
"C:\Users\Mitchell\Desktop\Temp Upload Folder"
384x384 resolution .webp thumbnails to be generated
Metadata should ideally be parsed as photo information is kept in file

Music files or easier Spotify/Youtube embeds

Embeds for a Typescript + pixi.js game hosted on Github pages

Possibly 3D models that can be viewed in browser (might be too much though unless sectioned off)
